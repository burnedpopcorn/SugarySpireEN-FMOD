# SugarySpireEN-FMOD
A Recreation of the FMOD Project for Sugary Spire Exhibition Night

# About
This recreation is seperate from theloser's [FMOD Recreation](https://github.com/theloser7455/SugarySpireFMOD-Recreation), as it was completely generated by the [FMOD Decompiler](https://github.com/stuttermess/FMOD-Decompiler/), which was made by me and catmateo

This one was made since the original one was missing events, had them in the wrong places, and had some empty events

However, the original fmod recreation was used as a reference for some things like sound position and loop regions

# Requirements 
- [FMOD Studio 2.02](https://www.fmod.com/download#fmodstudio)
- That's it

# Credits
- Me and CatMateo, for the [FMOD Decompiler](https://github.com/stuttermess/FMOD-Decompiler/)
- TheLoser, for the [Original FMOD Recreation](https://github.com/theloser7455/SugarySpireFMOD-Recreation)
